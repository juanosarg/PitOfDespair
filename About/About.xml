Store your prisoners in a bottomless pit.

&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
- Adds a new building, the Pit of Despair, where you can throw up to 10 prisoners. You can also throw food in the pit. Or not.
- Prisoners inside the pit won't be able to escape or affect those outside, but they will die if not fed. They MAY also be deeply traumatized by the experience.
- Consecrate your Pit to several deities from the Rim of Madness - Cults mod.

&lt;size=24&gt;Compatibility&lt;/size&gt;
Should be savegame compatible and not break anything. Should!
